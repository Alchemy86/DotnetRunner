# Dotnet Runner
Electron app to manage running multiple Dotnet Core applications.

This is currently in very early pre-release. 

* *Do* expect to be able to run multiple dotnet Apps from a single button click
* *Do* expect auto updates based on GitHub releases.
* *Do* expect regular updates.
* *Do* expect form validation on user input.
* *Do* expect some attempt at a partially pretty UI (WIP)
* ~~*Don't* expect any validation on user input.~~
* *Don't* expect any graceful error handling.
* ~~*Don't* expect any form or pretty UI or intuitive UX.~~
* *Don't* expect anything to be tested.

This is in active development so changes should be a regular occurrence.
